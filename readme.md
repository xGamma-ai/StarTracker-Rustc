# StarTracker Rustc

The standalone API server for StarTracker Native app.

## To actively build the server ```src``` file
```shell
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo watch -w src -x run
```

## Install diesel CLI
```shell
cargo binstall diesel_cli
```

## diesel.rs Migrations
```shell
# Run diesel migration on a LOCAL instances to setup DB.
# Any new migrations also need to have revert option inside donw.sql
diesel migration run
```

## Run Tests
```shell

cargo test --test mod
```

## Reqs:
- [ ] Setup diesel CLI, find at https://diesel.rs
- [ ] Don't edit ```schema.rs``` file. It is autogenerated by ```diesel setup```
- [ ] Change binding from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 for local dev.
